Flag-Find Frenzy - User Guide
==============================

Purpose
- Guess country flags, learn a quick fact, and climb the leaderboard.
- Uses the local data in `facts/` (text facts) and `data/*` (flag images).

Requirements
- Python 3.8+ 
- Run from the project folder so image/fact paths resolve correctly.

Quick Start
2) Launch the game: `python3 main.py`
3) The window opens to the Start screen; choose a mode or keep the default `mix up`, then click Start.

Game Modes & Question Types
- `mix up`: pulls from every difficulty.
- `easy` / `standard`: multiple-choice buttons.
- `advanced` / `expert`: type your answer in the input box and press Submit.

Playing the Game
- Each round shows a flag and the question counter. Multiple-choice modes display up to four buttons; typing modes show a text box.
- Pick or type your answer. Feedback appears with the correct country and a fun fact.
- Click Next Question to continue until all questions finish (up to 10 per game).
- Flags come from `data/easy|standard|advanced|expert`, facts from matching files in `facts/`.


Fact & Result flow
- After each guess you see: "Nice job!" or "Not quite." plus the correct answer and its fact.
- Result screen: Final Score, name box, Save Score, Play Again, and a note to open Leaderboard.

Troubleshooting
- If the window shows broken images, confirm you ran from the repo root so relative paths in `main.py` resolve.
- To clear saved scores, delete `data/leaderboard.txt` (optional backup first).
